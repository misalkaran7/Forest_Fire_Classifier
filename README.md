# Forest_Fire_ClassifierHere’s a professional and complete **README.md** file for your wildfire detection project, ready for GitHub:

# 🌍 Wildfire Detection and Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery

**Author:** Karan Misal  
**Project Type:** Capstone Project (Solo)  
**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib  
**SDG Goals:** Climate Action, Life on Land  

---

## 🔥 Project Overview

Wildfires are one of the most destructive natural disasters, severely impacting forests, wildlife, air quality, and human life. This project presents an intelligent solution using deep learning to **automatically detect wildfire occurrences from satellite images.**

Using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model can classify satellite imagery as either **Wildfire Detected** or **No Wildfire**. It can be integrated into a real-time monitoring system using open satellite data sources such as **MODIS** or **VIIRS**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Binary classification: Fire / No Fire
- Uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Preprocessing and data augmentation included
- Model evaluation with accuracy and loss plots
- Supports real-time prediction on new satellite images

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model includes:

- Convolutional Layers
- MaxPooling Layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully Connected Dense Layers
- Sigmoid output activation for binary classification

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Input**: Satellite images
- **Labels**: `0` for No Fire, `1` for Wildfire
- Images are resized to a fixed dimension and normalized
- Dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets

## 🛠️ Installation Requirements

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wildfire-detector.git
cd wildfire-detector
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate for Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is not present, install manually:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

To train the model and make predictions, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook wildfire_classifier.ipynb
```

You can modify the last section to test the model on custom images using OpenCV or PIL.

---

## 📊 Results

* **Training Accuracy:** \~95%
* **Validation Accuracy:** \~92%
* Clear distinction observed between fire and non-fire classes.

Accuracy and loss graphs show good convergence with no significant overfitting.

---

## 🔔 Future Enhancements

* Integrate with live satellite feeds using APIs
* Add location tagging using GIS
* Send real-time alerts via email or SMS
* Deploy on cloud (using Flask + Streamlit or FastAPI)
